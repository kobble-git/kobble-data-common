### Organizing Your Data
Kobble let's you organize your data into *Channel Groups*, *Channels*, *Tracks*, and *Items*, similar to YouTube or Spotify.

* A Channel Group is a group of Channels. 
* A Channel is a group of Tracks. 
* A Track is a tree or outline of Items. Items in the Track tree support drag and drop reordering.
