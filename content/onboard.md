### You Control Your Data
*You control all of your data*. Kobble stores all data on [GitHub](https://github.com), in *your* account. This gives you complete control over your data. We don't store any data on our servers. In fact, none of your data is even transmitted to our servers. It's all sent directly from your browser to [GitHub](https://github.com).  {.left}

### Organizing Your Data
Kobble lets you organize your data into *Channel Groups*, *Channels*, *Tracks*, and *Items*, similar to YouTube or Spotify.

::: slide 
* A Channel Group is a group of Channels. 
* A Channel is a group of Tracks. 
* A Track is a tree or outline of Items. Items in the Track tree support drag and drop reordering.
* Items are usually Markdown files, but Kobble also supplies a variety of specialized Items for other purposes.
